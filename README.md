## Generalized Temperley-Lieb Algebras in Sage

This repository (specifically, the `tl-algebra`) branch contains an impelementation of *Generalized Temperley-Lieb algebras* in SageMath.
The implementation is entirely contained in [src/sage/combinat/generalized_temperley_lieb_algebra.py](src/sage/combinat/generalized_temperley_lieb_algebra.py).

This code was developed with the help and direction of [Tianyuan Xu](https://math.colorado.edu/~tixu6187/), as part of an [REU](https://math.colorado.edu/~tixu6187/srm2020.html) at the University of Colorado Boulder.

For a an example application of this code, see [https://math.colorado.edu/~chme3268/diagrams/](https://math.colorado.edu/~chme3268/diagrams/).

For a demo Jupyter notebook with basic usage, see [https://math.colorado.edu/~chme3268/research/tlnotebookdemo](https://math.colorado.edu/~chme3268/research/tlnotebookdemo).
