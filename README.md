## Generalized Temperley-Lieb Algebras in Sage

This repository branch (`tl-algebra`) contains an impelementation of Temperley--Lieb (TL) algebras of types A, B, and H in [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/).
The code can perform computations in the TL algebras and plot TL diagrams in these algebras; the basic usage is demonstrated in the Jupyter notebook at [https://math.colorado.edu/~chme3268/research/tlnotebookdemo](https://math.colorado.edu/~chme3268/research/tlnotebookdemo).
A gallery of TL diagrams can be found at [https://math.colorado.edu/~chme3268/diagrams/](https://math.colorado.edu/~chme3268/diagrams/).

This code was developed with the help and direction of [Tianyuan Xu](https://math.colorado.edu/~tixu6187/), as part of an [REU](https://math.colorado.edu/~tixu6187/srm2020.html) at the University of Colorado Boulder.

The implementation is contained in the file [src/sage/combinat/generalized_temperley_lieb_algebra.py](src/sage/combinat/generalized_temperley_lieb_algebra.py).
